## Filament 3

## Version 3 Changes To Focus On
- Resources are located in `app/Filament/Resources/` directory.
- Resource pages (List, Create, Edit) are auto-generated within the resource's directory - e.g., `app/Filament/Resources/PostResource/Pages/`.
- Forms use the `Forms\Components` namespace for form fields.
- Tables use the `Tables\Columns` namespace for table columns.
- A new `Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor` component is available.
- Form and table schemas now use fluent method chaining.
- Added `php artisan filament:optimize` command for production optimization.
- Requires implementing `FilamentUser` contract for production access control.
