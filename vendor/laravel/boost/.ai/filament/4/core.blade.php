## Filament 4

### Important Version 4 Changes
- File visibility is now `private` by default.
- The `deferFilters` method from Filament v3 is now the default behavior in Filament v4, so users must click a button before the filters are applied to the table. To disable this behavior, you can use the `deferFilters(false)` method.
- The `Grid`, `Section`, and `Fieldset` layout components no longer span all columns by default.
- The `all` pagination page method is not available for tables by default.
- All action classes extend `Filament\Actions\Action`. No action classes exist in `Filament\Tables\Actions`.
- The `Form` & `Infolist` layout components have been moved to `Filament\Schemas\Components`, for example `Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, `Tabs`, `Wizard`, etc.
- A new `Repeater` component for Forms has been added.
- Icons now use the `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` Enum by default. Other options are available and documented.

### Organize Component Classes Structure
- Schema components: `Schemas/Components/`
- Table columns: `Tables/Columns/`
- Table filters: `Tables/Filters/`
- Actions: `Actions/`
