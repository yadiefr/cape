## Introduction

Laravel Boost accelerates AI-assisted development by providing the essential context and structure that AI needs to generate high-quality, Laravel-specific code.

At its foundation, Laravel Boost is an MCP server equipped with over 15 specialized tools designed to streamline AI-assisted coding workflows. The package includes composable AI guidelines specifically crafted for Laravel ecosystem packages, ensuring consistent and framework-appropriate code generation.

Boost also features a powerful Documentation API that combines a built-in MCP tool with an extensive knowledge base containing over 17,000 pieces of Laravel-specific information, all enhanced by semantic search capabilities using embeddings for precise, context-aware results.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Laravel Boost is currently in beta and receives frequent updates as we refine features and expand capabilities.

## Installation

Laravel Boost can be installed via Composer:

```bash
composer require laravel/boost --dev
```

Next, install the MCP server and coding guidelines:

```bash
php artisan boost:install
```

Once Laravel Boost has been installed, you're ready to start coding with Cursor, Claude Code, or your AI agent of choice.

## Adding Custom AI Guidelines

To augment Laravel Boost with your own custom AI guidelines, add `.blade.php` files to your application's `.ai/guidelines/*` directory. These files will automatically be included with Laravel Boost's guidelines when you run `boost:install`.

## Manually Registering the Boost MCP Server

Sometimes you may need to manually register the Laravel Boost MCP server with your editor of choice. You should register the MCP server using the following details:

<table>
<tr><td><strong>Command</strong></td><td><code>php</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Args</strong></td><td><code>./artisan boost:mcp</code></td></tr>
</table>

JSON Example:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "laravel-boost": {
            "command": "php",
            "args": ["./artisan", "boost:mcp"]
        }
    }
}
```
