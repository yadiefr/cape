## Introduction

Laravel Roster detects which Laravel ecosystem packages are in use within a project, and gives you an easy to use API to work with that data.


## Installation
To get started, install Roster via Composer:

```bash
composer require laravel/roster
```

## Usage

**Scan a directory**

Get a roster of installed packages by scanning a directory:

```php
use Laravel\Roster\Roster;

$roster = Roster::scan($directory);
```

**Query the roster**
```php
// Get all packages
$roster->packages();

// Get only packages that will be used in production
$roster->packages()->production();

// Packages that are only used for dev
$roster->packages()->dev();

// Check if a package is in use
$roster->uses(Packages::INERTIA);

// Check if a particular version of a package is in use
$roster->usesVersion(Packages::INERTIA, '2.0.0', '>=');
```
